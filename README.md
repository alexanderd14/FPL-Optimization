# Introduction 
I have always followed football, but I have never been much of a fan of fantasy sports, especially Fantasy Premier League. There's so much uncertainty, the sesason is arduously long, and my luck has never been that good. However, this season (20/21) my friends convinced my to give it a try. I ended up waiting until the last minute to create my team and simply threw together some player that I thought would have success. My hopes weren't very high but somehow as 2020 came to an end I was within striking distance of the top of the table. At almost half way through the season I was looking to use my wild card, and I thought some data modeling and optimization could improve my chances.

The prospect of having a chance at winning lead me to an FPL API (https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/bootstrap-static) and ecouraged me to explore the data and write a bit of code.

# EDA
After creating my dataframes and cleaning up the data, I decided to draw out some basic patterns. For example looking at the relationship between the in-game price of a player and their total point production in the season so far.
